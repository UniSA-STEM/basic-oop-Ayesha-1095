class Hacker:
    """
    Represents a hacker in the digital underworld who begins with one CryptoToken, no rig,
    and a trace level of 0. Hackers can acquire rigs, launch data spikes, encrypt or decrypt
    assets, transfer items, and upgrade rigs. Performing risky actions increases the trace level,
    and exceeding a threshold may restrict certain abilities.

    Attributes:
        __name (str): The hacker's name.
        __inventory (list): A list of digital assets the hacker owns.
        __rig (Rig): The hacker's associated rig, which can be upgraded.
        __trace_level (int): The hacker's exposure level to being traced.
